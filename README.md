# 👋 Hi, I'm Facu Gonzalez!

Hey there! 👋 I'm a software engineer with a decade of experience and a passion for building reliable, high-performance applications from the ground up. Recently, I've been diving deeper into systems programming, concurrency, and distributed systems, which I find incredibly rewarding as it pushes me to balance theory with real-world applications.

As a fan of automation and cloud-native technologies, I enjoy leveraging tools like GitHub Actions, GitLab Runners, and Jenkins to make CI/CD pipelines seamless. You’ll often find me refining container orchestration with Docker and Kubernetes to boost scalability and resilience. Nothing beats the challenge of making complex systems work in sync through strategic refactoring and architectural foresight!

## 🎓 Education & Current Focus

- 🎓 Bachelor’s in Computer Science, finishing my thesis on _concurrency models across C, Python, and Go_
- 🔍 Exploring advanced topics like scheduler design in Rust, distributed systems, and work stealing
- 📈 Driven to transition into systems and distributed programming, where I can apply deep technical skills to impactful, low-level work
